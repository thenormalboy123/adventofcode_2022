# adventofcode_2022

Hello! This is just a repo for me to upload all my codes that I submitted for Advent Of Code 2022. 
All codes are written in python.

All the challenges can be found <a href= "https://adventofcode.com/2022/"> here </a> 

For the most part, I did not write comments for my code, but rest assured it works! :) 
I will include comments when I have the time to

To run the code: 
1) download python file and the corresponding input.txt and place them in the same folder 
2) open terminal / cmd prompt on that directory 
3) run py ./<filename.py>
